### Video Notes
- Quick Overview (The Story)
	- Started trying to dive into adding some kind of VGA commands BUT realized it was almost impossible to edit kernel.c (turning into spaghetti code)
	- Split kernel.c into different source files and headers
	- Rewrite Makefile to be modular (but not recursive!)
	- Fix ISO build in Docker
- Lessons Learned
	- How to structure GNU Make Makefiles using include directive
	- How header files work - was always a mystery to me until now sadly
