> [interrupt instructions of 8086](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMEpwDHRO4)
-   Interrupt - stop execution of CPU for a short time
-   Microprocessor responds to interrupt signal using ISR - Interrupt Service Routine
    -   This is a short program to indicate how to handle the interrupt
-   Keyboard, mouse produce interrupts
-   Types of Interrupt
    -   HW interrupts
        -   Maskable - You can mask the interrupt (?) and continue main program
        -   Non-maskable - you must stop and handle it (?)
        -   Other types (?)
            -   NMT
            -   INTR
            -   INTA
    -   SW interrupts
        -   256 types
        -   Can be inserted to test hardware interrupts (?)
        -   Types
            -   INT - interrupt instruction with type \#
            -   INT3 - Breakpoint of interrupt instruction

-   IDTR register: special register to hold base address and length of Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
-   Entries (vectors) can be Interrupt Gates, Trap Gates, or (32-bit protected only) Task Gates
    -   Interrupt Gate: Point to executable code (segment/offset). Disable handling further HW interrupts.
    -   Trap Gate: Point to executable code (segment/offset). Do not disable handling further HW interrupts.
        -   Mainly for SW interrupts and exceptions
    -   Task Gate: Switch current task-state segment
        -   Use HW mechanism to hand over process to another program/thread/process
-   Vectors 0-31 are reserved for Intel processor exceptions

-   Add to command launching qemu: \`-monitor stdio\`
    -   Use \"info registers\" to see em all
    -   You can all do print \$eax and so forth
    -   x/10hx 0xb8000: print 10 bytes of video memory starting at 0xb8000

> When you enter protected mode (or even before hand, if you\'re not using [GRUB](https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB)) the first command you will need to give the two PICs is the initialise command (code 0x11). This command makes the PIC wait for 3 extra \"initialisation words\" on the data port. These bytes give the PIC:
-   Its vector offset. (ICW2)
-   Tell it how it is wired to master/slaves. (ICW3)

-   IDTR register holds the interrupt descriptor table
    -   Change this with the \`lidt\` instruction
    -   Structure is:
        -   Bits 0-15: Limit. Length of the IDT in bytes minus one.
        -   Bits 16-47: Base. This is the 32-bit starting address for the first IDT entry
-   IDT Entry structure
    -   These populate the IDT
    -   Offset: 32-bit address representing entry-point of ISR (interrupt service routine) that will service the interrupt. Split into two parts (upper and lower bits
    -   Fields:
        -   (16 bits) Offset_lowerbits: Bits 0-15 of the offset.
        -   (16 bits) Selector: Code segment selector; must point to a valid code sector in GDT or LDT (global/local descriptor table)
        -   (8 bits) zero: 8 unused bits that should be set to 0
        -   (8 bits) type_attr: Type and attribute bits
        -   (16 bits) offset_upperbits: Bits 16-31 of the offset
    -   Type and attribute bits
        -   Bit 0: P.
        -   Bits 1-2: DPL.
            -   Descriptor Privilege Level
            -   Called Descriptor must have at least this privilege level
            -   I believe this ties into Ring 0, Ring 1, etc.
        -   Bit 3: S. Storage segment. 0 for interrupt and trap gates
        -   Bits 4-7: Gate Type
            -   0x5: 32-bit task gate
            -   0x6: 16-bit interrupt gate
            -   0x7: 16-bit trap gate
            -   0x14: 32-bit interrupt gate
            -   0x15: 32-bit trap gate
    -   Code segment
        -   This should be set to the kernel\'s selector in our case (Ring 0). Simplest version will have only one code segment entry in GDT anyway

> Breaking down the mkeykernel code:

keyboard_address = (unsigned long)keyboard_handler;
-   > We use 'extern' to grab a reference to the keyboard_handler as a FUNCTION from our ASM file
-   > This line converts that function reference to an actual number - unsigned long means it will be 32 bits for x86 32-bit
    -   > For 32-bit, unsigned long and unsigned int appear to both be 32-bits

IDT[0x21].offset_lowerbits = keyboard_address & 0xffff;
-   > Grab the lower bits of our keyboard address. AND with 0xffff to get ONLY the bottom 32 bits
-   > In other words, we are ANDing with 0x0000FFFF for the long. This is then stored as 16 bits

IDT[0x21].selector = KERNEL_CODE_SEGMENT_OFFSET;
-   > 0x8 is the first entry in the GDT following the null entry. Did a deep dive to figure this out below

IDT[0x21].zero = 0;

-   > Seems that interrupt gates are typically kernel-space and hardware interrupts
-   > Trap gates are typically user-space and CPU instructions (maybe SW interrupts?)

IDT[0x21].offset_higherbits = (keyboard_address & 0xffff0000) >> 16;

-   Self explanatory, grab the upper bits of keyboard address and shift them down 16 bits to get JUST those upper bits in a 16 bit integer.

-   Find out with QEMU
-   Running \'make run\' on commit d03720c from pkos repo
    -   Print registers: \"info registers\"
    -   GDT= 000caa68 00000027
        -   Let\'s figure out what this means: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table>
        -   Limit (size) is 16 bits or 2 bytes
        -   Base (starting address) is 32 bits or 4 bytes
        -   GDTR from QEMU appears to have 8 bytes. So there must be some padding (GDT is only 6)
        -   This leads me to:
        -   00c = ??
        -   Aa68 = Limit?
        -   00000027 = Base?
-   What about when we set this up ourselves in OS? Checking out os7 to try it. Commit 7f9bf3c
    -   Have to add -monitor stdio to qemu command in Makefile
    -   Print registers: \"info registers\"
    -   GDT= 00007c05 00000017
        -   In our code we set the following (<https://github.com/stephengrice/pkos/blob/7f9bf3c8370e5316c5f8219c73eaac53d4c474c9/src/inc/gdt.asm>)
        -   Actually, the GDT descriptor stored in GDTR was dynamically defined:

| gdt_descriptor: |                                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|                 | dw gdt_end - gdt_start - 1 ; Size of GDT, always less one |
|                 | dd gdt_start                                              |

-   Can confirm the GDT is now different as of commit xxxx
    -   GDT= 00100010 00000017
-   Per Alex\'s post, selector 0 is the null entry, 0x8 is the first entry, 0x10 the second, etc.
    -   SO we could have just used the mkeykernel constant of 0x8, but now at least we know where it came from :)

    -   This show the number of bytes in each datatype for C
> **Why is IDT_SIZE 256?**
-   Arjun Sreedharan answers this question on his blog and cites <https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupts>
> There are 256 interrupt vectors on x86 CPUs, numbered from 0 to 255 which act as entry points into the kernel. The number of interrupt vectors or entry points supported by a CPU differs based on the CPU architecture.

> The Interrupt Gate is used to specify an [interrupt service routine](https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupt_Service_Routines). When you do [INT](https://wiki.osdev.org/INT) 50 in assembly, running in protected mode, the CPU looks up the 50th entry (located at 50 \* 8) in the IDT.

> There are two basic ways to set breakpoints in your code.
>
> The first, more common, type is a "software breakpoint". When you ask the debugger to set a breakpoint at a certain statement, it will find the first assembly instruction associated with that statement. It will then replace this instruction with a different, special instruction, that when executed will cause control to be transferred from the debugee (the program being debugged) to the debugger.
>
> The second type is a "hardware breakpoint". This requires more specialized hardware support. With hardware breakpoints, the debugger configures the CPU to transfer control to the debugger when an instruction at a certain address is executed. Note that this means we don't need to change the instruction itself, we only need to know the address.
>
> gdb's "break" command will set a breakpoint - but it doesn't commit to the type of breakpoint that will be set. "hbreak", on the other hand, will always use a hardware breakpoint. So, you really ought to always use break, unless you know you specifically need a hardware breakpoint, and also know gdb won't be able to figure this out on its own.
>
> When would you need one? For most people, the answer is probably never. But there is an exception. We just said that using a hardware breakpoint means the code doesn't have to be changed. So if for some reason the code simply can not be changed - for instance, if it resides in read-only memory - a hardware breakpoint is pretty much your only option.
>
> Note that there is a related concept called [hardware watchpoints](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Watchpoints.html) which is much more useful. But those are not set with hbreak. Rather, like with break - you should use the "watch" command, and gdb will decide what kind of watchpoint it will use, hardware or software.
